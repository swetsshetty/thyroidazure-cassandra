Thyroid disease a very common problem in India especially in female. Thyroid disorder can speed up or slow down the metabolism of the body. Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism are the most two common diseases caused by irregular functioning of thyroid gland.
 Machine learning plays an important role in predicting the thyroid disease. Machine learning algorithms helps in early detection of the disease and to improve the quality of the life. Different classification algorithms can forecasts the presence of the disease such as Logistic regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, XG Boost, KNN.
 In the present work, the machine learning algorithms like logistic algorithm, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and XG Boost algorithm are used for classification of thyroid disease. Based on the obtained result Decision Trees algorithm is used to predict the thyroid disease. Web app is created to get data from users to predict the type of disease using flask. The user input and result is stored in Cassandra cloud database and the finally model is deployed on Azure cloud platform
